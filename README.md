# To-Do-List-Android-App
This application as the name suggests will be a To-Do list holding app. It’ll store the users schedules and their upcoming meetings or events. In this application, users will be enabled to write their important notes as well. So, this app will have a area to write their tasks, events, or important notes. We can build it in android studio using Java and XML at ease. Using XML we can build the user interface as user-friendly. And to store the user’s data, we can use SQLite enabling the users to even delete the data permanently. Now for users, they will open up the app and get access to the write section. Here the users can note down the things and store them permanently. Users can also delete the data.
Working:
To-Do List project is an application specially built to keep track of errands or
tasks that need to be done. This application will be like a task keeper where the
user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. Once they are done
with their tasks they can also remove them from the list.
We can add the tasks that are to be done in a
descriptive way. We will be able to add as many
tasks as you have.
Once the task is completed, we will be able to remove it by clicking on “Task
Completed” button.
Following are the user interface components that will be shown in our
application-
There will be an add task button on the right top of the application.
There will be a button “Task Completed” for each task added, so you will be
able to delete it. The tasks that will be added by the users are stored in the list
view.
After running the application, following steps needs to be followed:
1. Now begin working on the app, click on the “ + ” button on the top right.
2. Now, here we can type the task that we want to add.
3. We can write the task as follows and then click on add. Similarly add few more.
4. Now, to remove the completed task from the task list, simply click
on the Task Completed button.
This is how the project will function and help us keep a well-maintained track
of the tasks or the meetings that we need to complete.
