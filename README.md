# To-Do-List-Android-App
This application as the name suggests will be a To-Do list holding app. It’ll store the users schedules and their upcoming meetings or events. In this application, users will be enabled to write their important notes as well. So, this app will have a area to write their tasks, events, or important notes. We can build it in android studio using Java and XML at ease. Using XML we can build the user interface as user-friendly. And to store the user’s data, we can use SQLite enabling the users to even delete the data permanently. Now for users, they will open up the app and get access to the write section. Here the users can note down the things and store them permanently. Users can also delete the data.
